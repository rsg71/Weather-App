# Weather-App


This weather dashboard displays the daily weather information for any city worldwide. The temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index are returned upon each search, in addition to an icon representation of the weather conditions. The UV index is color-coded based on its value: lower than 3 is green (low), between 3 and 7 is yellow (moderate), and over 7 is red (high).

In addition, the temperature, humidity, and wind speed information are returned for a five day forecast. Users log their search terms in a list, and this search history can be clicked to return the information again for the chosen city.
